    "Gentrification, on its face, is a natural and beneficial process of urban development: as an older, dilapidated community is renovated with new developments, an influx of wealthy homeowners and businesses soon follow. This in turn leads to further gentrification and the cycle continues until the region is completely changed economically, racially, and politically.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a darker side to gentrification, a series of hidden costs that muddy the dialogue surrounding the benefits of gentrification; as wealthy homeowners and businesses move into a community, house prices and their related costs, such as taxes and mortgages, markedly increase. These increased costs force out established residents into lower-income neighborhoods; the associated stress, tension, and friction that arises from such community displacement can often present itself as an uptick of crime, in particular violent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report seeks to analyze and quantify the nature of gentrification in the neighborhoods of Atlanta, Georgia. It explains for social scientists the telltale signs of societal changes in the neighborhoods of Atlanta and how violent crime rates increase over time in the surrounding displacement communities. Additionally, for residents of Atlanta as well as potential homeowners of Atlanta, this report seeks to illuminate the regions that are most likely to become gentrified in the near future, as well as point out the regions to which those regions' residents may be displaced."
